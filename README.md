# CS50P---Progress

This course is basically to whip me into shape for the rest of CS50x where they started programming in Python. I found myself really lost when we did the Python sections and want to properly equip myself to understanding what is being taught and execute code. So this course will be a slight detour to CS50X

Each branch will be equivalent to each week in the course. I will be posting my solutions and thoughts at the start of each branch

Onwards!
