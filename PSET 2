#Below will be a collection of PSET 2 questions alongside a brief description at the top of my tasks

#1. Had to check for user input and turn any camel case into snake case

def main():
    text = input("Camel case: ")

    for capital in text:
        if capital == capital.upper():
            print("_" + capital.lower(), end='')
        else:
            print(capital, end='')

    print()

main()

#2. Show the user how much they owe whilst only accepting certain denominations of coins

def main():
    coke = 50

    while coke > 0:
        text = int(input("Insert Coin: "))

        #Only accepts these denominations of coins
        if text == 25 or text == 10 or text == 5:
            coke -= text
            print("Amount Due:", coke)
        #Show balance after each
        else:
             print("Amount Due:", coke)

    #Show change (if any and ignoring case)
    print("Change Owed:", abs(coke))

main()
