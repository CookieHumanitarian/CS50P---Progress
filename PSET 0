# Below will be a list of simple problems set (PSET) given to me. Above each PSET will be a brief description of what my task is

#1. Write a program that accepts user input and turns it all to lowercase

def main():
    text = input().lower()
    print(text)

main()



#2. Write a program that replaces the space in between each word with '...'

def main():
    text = input().replace(' ', '...')
    print(text)

main()

#3. Replace ':)' and ':(' in a string with its emoji equivalent

def main():
    text = input().replace(':(', 'üôÅ').replace(':)', 'üôÇ')
    print(text)

main()

#4. Asks for user input and caculate Einstein's formula

def main():
    mass = int(input("Mass: "))

    c = 300000000 * 300000000 * mass

    print("E: ", c)

main()

#5. Remove unnecessary characters and calculate the tip
def main():
    dollars = dollars_to_float(input("How much was the meal? "))
    percent = percent_to_float(input("What percentage would you like to tip? "))
    tip = dollars * percent
    print(f"Leave ${tip:.2f}")


def dollars_to_float(d):
    d = float(d.replace('$', ''))
    return d


def percent_to_float(p):
    p = float(p.replace('%', ''))
    p = p / 100
    return p


main()
