#. Practise with regex where I had to validate an IP address. There is actually a proper full notation for the regex of IP addresses but I decided to take a 
# more verbose option instead of copy pasting everything

#2. So far, the toughest regex I've had to do. I had to extract the Youtube URL from an embedded link. A lot of time spent on the logic of it but it can
# finally embed the two types of HTML from youtube

    print(parse(input("HTML: ")))

    if link := re.search(r'(?:.*)src="(?:.*)embed/(\w+)".*$', s):
